               <span><h2>WHY PROGRAMMING</h2></span>
               <span><p>I've always been a tech savvy kind of guy but my interest in programming began back in 2020.I was on attachment where i was working under an Architect. I remember one day we were having a dialog and i asked him what is one thing he regrets having not done in Uni. I remember his answer so vividly, he told me that he regrets so much but the main one was that he wishes he made an effort in learning code. And so I took that as a sign and never looked back.</p></span>
