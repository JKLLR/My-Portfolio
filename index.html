            <h2>WHY PROGRAMMING</h2>
            <p>I've always been a tech savvy kind of guy but my interest in programming began back in 2020.I was on attachment where i was working under an Architect. I remember one day we were having a dialog and i asked him what is one thing he regrets having not done in Uni. I remember his answer so vividly, he told me that he regrets so much but the main one was that he wishes he made an effort in learning code. And so I took that as a sign and never looked back.</p>

            <h1>PASSION</h1>
            <p>i'm a versatile guy when it comes to things I like. Interests come and go but I would say I'm a guy who is really passionate about sports and art. I'm usually interested in different types of sports but the main ones include football, UFC and Formula 1 in that order. i would say I like art because it's a field that allows me to practise my creativity.</p>
